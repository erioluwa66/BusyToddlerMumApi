    notes: [
      "It is extremely important to remove as much moisture from the zucchini as possible. Excess moisture will result in an over moist mixture that will cause the bites to be soggy. You can use your hands or a towel, but I find that using a nut milk bag is the easiest way to remove the most moisture.",
      "This recipe makes 24 mini zucchini pizza bites.",
